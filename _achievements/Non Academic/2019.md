With the outstanding results achieved by the Floorball Senior Teams, the Floorball Junior Teams lived up to the high expectations. To gear up for the tournament, players were given frequent after-school trainings on Mondays and Fridays. Furthermore, many players had to readjust to the new tournament format. Despite the intensive trainings and new implementations, our young Damai Dragons partook in the 2019 National School Games and persevered against all odds. They did the school proud where both Girls and Boys Teams clinched the 1st and 2nd place in their groups respectively.
