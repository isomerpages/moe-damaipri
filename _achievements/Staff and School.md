### Clean Plate Campaign 2020
![](/images/2020%20clean%20plate%20campaign.jpeg)

Clean Plate Campaign (CPC) is started in conjunction with World Food Day – a global movement to end hunger and reduce food wastage. This year, CPC was done a bit differently compared to the previous years in 2 different ways:
  

1. For every clean plate counted, $1 will be donated to FFTH food programme – Project Belanja! Where lower income beneficiaries get to enjoy a hot meal. (Officially, $50000 from sponsors is the amount pooled together for this project.)

2. Staff from Food From the Heart (FFTH) did not come down to count the clean plates for us. Mr Arasan, Mrs Mak, Shirley and Christine Lim helped to do the counting during the various recesses, together with some students from 6A, 6E and some prefects from Primary 5 level. We would like to thank them very much for their help!
 

The campaign lasted a week (12/10 to 16/10) and our school counted a total of 1,599 clean plates! However, we are not sure how much contributed to Project Belanja since the official sponsored amount is $50000. The photo below shows the certificate given by FFTH.

  

Thank you to all staff and students for participating in Clean Plate Campaign 2020.

### SCHOOL GREEN AWARD 2016 – LOTUS AWARD

![](/images/lotus%20award.png)

The SEC-StarHub School Green Awards is an environmental programme for all schools in Singapore which is aimed at educating learners on environmental issues such as energy conservation and waste minimisation.  

  

Damai Primary School was awarded the 2016&nbsp;**School Green Award – Lotus Award**&nbsp;in November for initiating innovative environment projects carried out by the staff and students of the school. The School Leaders and staff consciously role-model their commitment to manage and reduce the use of electricity, water and paper to the students who in turn are urged to adopt the 3Rs practices.  

  
The school also partnered the Northwest CDC and participated in a community outreach project to promote binning as a shared responsibility to keep the environment clean and green. The objectives of this ‘Live Green, Think Clean’ project are to develop a sense of personal responsibility and ownership for maintaining the cleanliness of the school's surrounding or vicinity in the neighbourhood in our students. This project is significant and it provides Damaiains the opportunities to experience the trials of performing a cleaner’s job and indeed they have a newfound respect and appreciation for workers who perform such services for them.
