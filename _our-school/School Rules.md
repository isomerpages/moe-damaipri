School Disciplinary Matters
---------------------------

The school believes that good discipline is an important factor to help create a positive school with a conducive environment for our students. Students learn well when there is order and discipline. While we try our best to teach and instil self-discipline in our students, we seek parents’ understanding that disciplinary action may be imposed on students who violated the school rules.
  
Students who have committed offences are referred to the Disciplinary Board which decides on the appropriate consequences. Disciplinary action meted out to the student will depend on the severity of the offence. These can be in the form of:  

• Warning Letter* <br>
• Detention <br>
• Corrective Work <br>
• Suspension <br>
• Caning  

Thereafter, the errant student(s) will be counselled.
