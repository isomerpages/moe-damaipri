Welcome to Damai Primary School! We warmly embrace and welcome every child into our Damai family.  

  

We believe that every Damaian can learn, grow and lead, and every Damaian wants and can succeed! Through our culture of care and distinction, we focus on 5 key domains: Cognitive, Physical, Aesthetics, Social and Moral, to nurture all Damaians holistically and be ready for the future.

  

Our vision encapsulates the shared student outcomes we hope to see in our Damaians after their six years with Damai Primary. Our aspiration is for Damaians to be ‘Confident Individuals’ who demonstrate SPARK values, communicate effectively and want to make a difference. As ‘Thinking Learners’, Damaians will think critically and innovatively, and learn collaboratively. As ‘Engaged Leaders’, Damaians will care and have the courage to want to contribute. All Damaians will continue to be guided by SPARK values in all they do:

• **S**incerity to self and others 

• **P**assion for learning 

 • **A**spiration to succeed 

• **R**esilience in life

• **K**indness to all
