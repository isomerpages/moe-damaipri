Welcome to Damai Primary School! We warmly embrace and welcome every child into our Damai family.  

  

We believe that every Damaian can learn, grow and lead, and every Damaian wants and can succeed! Through our culture of care and distinction, we focus on 5 key domains: Cognitive, Physical, Aesthetics, Social and Moral, to nurture all Damaians holistically and be ready for the future.

  

Our vision encapsulates the shared student outcomes we hope to see in our Damaians after their six years with Damai Primary. Our aspiration is for Damaians to be ‘Confident Individuals’ who demonstrate SPARK values, communicate effectively and want to make a difference. As ‘Thinking Learners’, Damaians will think critically and innovatively, and learn collaboratively. As ‘Engaged Leaders’, Damaians will care and have the courage to want to contribute. All Damaians will continue to be guided by SPARK values in all they do:



		 
• **S**incerity to self and others 

• **P**assion for learning 

 • **A**spiration to succeed 

• **R**esilience in life

• **K**indness to all

As school and staff, we continue to be guided by a clear sense of purpose to provide a holistic student-centric, values-driven education to prepare our students for life. We will devote time and effort to help them build a solid foundation in numeracy and literacy, to be grounded in values, and develop skills in sports, aesthetics and leadership. Acknowledging that every Damaian is unique, we strive to enable each to grow and learn in a positive nurturing environment, discover the joy of learning and nurture their passion in overcoming new challenges. By forging strong partnership and close collaboration with parents and stakeholders, we are confident that every Damaian will be able to achieve his or her best in all that he or she undertakes.

**One Team, One Vision**

**Together, We Achieve More!**

We look forward to an exciting and enriching year for our Damaians.
