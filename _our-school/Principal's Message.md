Dear Parents and Guardians,

A warm welcome to the Damai Primary family! At Damai Primary School, we hold an unwavering belief
that each and every Damaian possesses the potential to learn, grow, and emerge as a leader. We firmly
believe that Damaians hold within them the capability to succeed.

Our approach towards education revolves around fostering holistic development, nurturing a growth
mindset, and instilling in our Damaians the confidence that they can overcome any challenge. We
channel our efforts towards five fundamental domains: Cognitive, Physical, Aesthetics, Social and Moral,
understanding that a balanced focus on these facets is key to preparing our Damaians for the
complexities of the future.

The vision we hold for our Damaians encapsulates the desired outcomes we strive for during their
transformative six-year journey at Damai Primary. We aspire for each Damaian to emerge as a 'Confident Individual' embodying the SPARK values - demonstrating effective communication skills, a desire to make a meaningful difference, and displaying confidence and competence. As 'Thinking Learners', we encourage critical thinking, innovation, and collaborative learning. Moreover, as 'Engaged Leaders', we nurture a sense of care and courage to contribute positively to their communities, guided consistently by our SPARK values::

		 
• **S**incerity to self and others

• **P**assion for learning

 • **A**spiration to succeed

• **R**esilience in life

• **K**indness to all

As a dedicated team of educators and support staff, our commitment is steadfast towards providing a
holistic, student-centric, values-driven education. We focus on nurturing a solid foundation in numeracy
and literacy, grounded in strong values, and fostering skills in sports, arts, and leadership. Recognizing the uniqueness of each Damaian, our aim is to provide a nurturing environment that enables growth,
encourages the joy of learning, and fosters a passion for overcoming obstacles.

We strongly believe in the power of collaboration and partnership. Together, with your invaluable
support and our collective efforts, we are confident that Damaians will unleash their full potential and
achieve excellence in all their endeavors.

Indeed, at Damai Primary, we operate as One Team with One Vision because Together, We Achieve
More! We eagerly anticipate an exciting and enriching year ahead for our Damaians!
