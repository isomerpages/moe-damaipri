# General Guidelines on Homework

### Definition of Homework

Homework refers to any learning activity that schools require students to complete outside of curriculum time, regardless of the mode of delivery (i.e. pen-and-paper, virtual/ online). This includes assignments and projects but not revision of school work or studying for tests and examinations.  

  

### Objectives of Homework

Effective use of Homework can help students to

• reinforce learning and deepen understanding of lessons taught

• allow students to regularly practise, and apply skills and concepts taught

• develop good study skills and habits 

• encourage greater ownership and responsibility for independent/self-directed learning

  

### Students’ Role

Students should:

Understand the purpose of homework and what is expected of them

• keep track of homework instructions and deadlines

• manage time well to ensure that homework is completed and submitted on time

• organise their school materials: study notes, assignments, books, papers, etc.  for revision

• give his/ her best effort in completing homework

• seek help from teachers, classmates or friends when they face difficulty

• review feedback from teachers on homework submitted

• complete corrections independently to reinforce learning after explanation by teachers

  

### Develop Good Study Habits

• write down homework/assignment updates in student’s handbook 

• have a home study timetable

• have a study area, away from household distractions

• have sufficient study materials to do their homework

  

### Long Term Benefits

With regular revision through Homework, students will:

• practise self-discipline and time management

• be more inquisitive

• be more independent

• be better problem solvers

All the above will result in good study habits and skills as well as improving their attitude towards school.

  

### Monitoring of Homework

Monitoring of Homework can provide parents with:

• timely information on the learning progress of the child

• opportunities to be involved in their child’s learning

  

### Parents’ Role

Parents can do the following to supervise their children homework:

• To create a home environment conducive for studying and completion of homework

• To guide and reinforce good study habits and attitudes

• To refer to the student’s handbook daily for updates on homework/assignment/feedback

• To spend time to go through the child’s school work

• To help the child to learn through homework assignments

• To consult teachers on the child’s progress

• To be mindful of the stresses arising from school homework and out-of-school activities, and help the child to prioritise his/her time among these activities

• To ensure that homework is done before their tuition work

• Parents are reminded not to do the homework for their children. They should also help their children to ensure that homework is done before their tuition work.
