**7. Why are the broadband options not fully subsidised under DigitalAccess@Home, like it was with NEU PC Plus?**

Co-payment is an important principle in the design of government assistance schemes as this is a prudent use of government funds in supporting the most needy households.

The new DigitalAccess@Home scheme has taken the above principle into consideration and will be based on co-payment format. We will continue to ensure that the co-payment amounts are reasonable for low-income households to obtain affordable digital access.
