### Programmes

**Opportunities for all Damaians: 4-tiered Leadership Approach**  

Damaians are provided opportunities in their daily classroom activities to take the lead in tasks by their teachers. Through common platforms to display their leadership, students who demonstrated strong leadership potential are talent scouted to continue their leadership career to the different tiers.

### Prefectorial Board

As student ambassadors of Damai Primary School, our prefects are given opportunities to contribute to the school and community. One of their contributions is safety duties during recess where they helped their peers and ensure everyone has a safe and enjoyable time during recess!

One of their key highlights in their leadership journey is to plan for Teachers’ Day celebration where they learnt about event management.

**Design for Change 2020 / 2021**

2019 saw the implementation of the Design For Change project, which provides our prefects with the platform to be leaders of change. Through the programme, prefects learn to employ the design thinking process of ‘Feel, Imagine, Do, Share’ to enable a positive change in their surrounding environment.

The Prefect Team of 2020 has done Damai Primary School proud by presenting their winning idea of turning food-waste into fertilisers. The team of Neo Kay Lin, Kieran Lee, Gan Hong Shui, Syafiqah Masri and Natalie Azali has gone on to share their project with local and international audience from the Design for Change: Be the Change event in 2020 and 2021 respectively.

Our 2021 Prefect Team has also put Damai Primary School on the map once again in Design for Change as their project of solving Littering in Canteen has been chosen to be a Singapore entry finalist in the next Design for Change: Be the Change. The team of Zavier Peh, Nur Aliya Husin, Kwan Ayane, Hannah Rahmah and Junita Sulaimi will be presenting their winning idea to other local participants. Well done!

  

**Prefect Investiture 2021**

Our Head Prefect, Neo Kay Lin (6A) led the Prefectorial Board 2021 together with two Vice-Head Prefects, Jeneth Png (6A) and Natalie Azali (6B) and PEXCO members, Jeneth Png (6A) and Kieran Lee (6A) in pledging their commitment to serve the school. This was also a major milestone for our Student Leadership Department as we held the event online due to the Safe Management Measures.

**Camp ALPHA 2021**  

Another first for our Damaian Leaders this year was the Camp ALPHA in which the Prefects and CCA Leaders were able to collaborate and learn from each other about leadership, peer support, motivating other and being the leader of change for the school. Despite not being able to hold a face-to-face training session, the leaders managed to enjoy and benefit from the workshop via interactive online activities and discussions.
