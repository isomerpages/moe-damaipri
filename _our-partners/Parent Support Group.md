A warm welcome to our Damai Family!  
  
In Damai Primary School, we believe in establishing strong partnership and engagement with parents in order for our children to thrive. By joining a Parent Support Group (PSG), parents will go beyond supporting your own child and contribute to a larger group of pupils in the school. As parent volunteers, they also have the opportunity of building rapport with teachers. With parents and school working hand in hand, we can support each other better as we develop our children to be confident and useful citizens of tomorrow.
