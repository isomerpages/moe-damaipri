### Learn for Life Programme  - Sports

![](/images/LLP%20sports%201.png)

**SPARK@Play Programme** caters to the holistic development of our students.

  

The approach is inclusive and anchored in values education. It aims to increase sporting opportunities to encourage sports participation in all students.

  

It is based on providing opportunities to cater to students at all levels, and of differing levels of ability. The broad philosophy is that the Expose modules seek to provide the breadth of learning for our children, inculcating joy of learning which is aligned to the Learn for Life movement.


The Equipment and Excel programs ensure that every student who has the interest, potential, or ability is provided with equal opportunities to fully optimise his/her interest by equiping them with attributes, competencies and core values to grow in strength of character through experience. Together with other school programmes, SPARK@Play contributes to the holistic education and development of 21st Century Competencies to better prepare each student to thrive in a fast-changing and highly-connected world.
