### Digital and Media Literacy through S.E.N.S.E. @ Damai

In our commitment to provide a holistic, student-centric and values-driven education, we are pleased to announce that our school is embarking on a new Applied Learning Programme (ALP) on Digital and Media Literacy in 2021. This ALP is aligned to our school’s vision of “Confident Individuals, Thinking Learners, Engaged Leaders”, so students will learn to use languages confidently and purposefully in authentic and real-world settings, empathise while communicating, as well as work harmoniously and respectfully with others to achieve their goals. The new ALP would also enable the students to acquire the right learning dispositions and habits by learning how to ask the right questions, how to sieve and extract relevant and useful information, and more importantly able to judge the credibility of information obtained and communicate information effectively through knowing how to use the various digital tools and media platforms like Photo Journalism, Video Journalism and Broadcast Journalism. We are confident that the ALP will help to nurture in the students a passion and desire to learn, explore and to be prepared to think out of the box.

  

### Photo Journalism

Our P3s have had an enjoyable and enriching learning experience on Photo Journalism. On 6th August, an external trainer walked them via Zoom on the characteristics that made up a good photo for journalism. They also had an interesting hands-on session on taking good photos using an iPad and writing meaningful captions that conveys a message. They then showcased their Photo Journalism skills on 27th August where they scoured the school campus to craft memorable accounts of our beautiful school.
