<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<h4><strong>LONG TERM RELOCATION PLANS OF DAMAI PRIMARY SCHOOL TO TAMPINES</strong></h4>
<p>The Ministry of Education will be announcing the relocation of some schools.
As you are one of our valued stakeholders, we would like to share with
you about the plans for Damai Primary School which will be relocated to <strong>Tampines Street 64</strong>.</p>
<p></p>

<p>This relocation, however, <strong>has no impact on your child who is currently studying in our Bedok campus.</strong> All
existing students will be able to graduate from this campus as the school
will remain fully operational till the end of December 2030.</p>
<h4><strong>Two-campus operations in 2029 and 2030</strong></h4>
<p>The new campus in Tampines <strong>will retain its name and come with a new MOE Kindergarten i.e. MK@Damai</strong>.
Both the MK and the primary school will start operating in Tampines Street
64 campus in January 2029. This will mean that Damai Primary School will
operate out of two campuses, ie. Bedok and Tampines for 2029 and 2030.</p>
<p>The new Tampines location has been chosen to serve the growing number
of families in Tampines’ new housing developments. Please refer to the
attached location plan for details.</p>
<h4><strong>Arrangement for students</strong></h4>
<p>We are committed to support all our current students in their educational
and learning experiences. Key adjustments to take note of during this period
of transition include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To minimise disruptions to existing students, <strong>all students currently enrolled in Damai Primary School will continue to study at the Bedok campus and be fully supported until end 2030.</strong> To
prepare for the relocation, Damai Primary School will not admit Primary
1 (P1) cohorts at the Bedok campus from 2026.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Damai Primary School (Bedok campus) will not admit P1 students from
2026 onwards, <strong>siblings of existing Damai Primary School students will not be able to register for Damai Primary School in the 2025 P1 Registration Exercise</strong>.
Parents/Guardians may choose to enrol their children/ward in other primary
schools in the area. MOE will ensure that there are sufficient P1 places
for all Singaporean Citizen and Singapore Permanent Resident P1 school-going
children in the Bedok area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school will <strong>admit its first cohorts of P1 students at the Tampines campus in 2029</strong>.
More details will be released closer to date.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The school and our teachers remain committed to your child/ward’s education
and will ensure that your child/ward’s educational experience remains the
best it can be even during this period of transition.</p>
<h4>New MOE Kindergarten @ Damai</h4>
<p>MOE will be setting up an MOE Kindergarten (MK) within Damai Primary School
at the new campus. The MK will enrol Kindergarten 1 (K1) children from
January 2029. The MK registration exercise for 2029 K1 admission will be
held in early 2028. More information on the MK curriculum, learning environment
and other locations around Singapore can be found at <a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/mk" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.moe.gov.sg/mk</a>.</p>
